# Loan Approval Prediction using Ensemble Learning

This project applies advanced machine learning techniques to predict loan approval outcomes.  
Ensemble methods such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost were used to improve accuracy and robustness.

## Files
- `AML_loan_approval_Ensemble.ipynb`: Main notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `loan_approval_dataset.csv`: Sample dataset (if small) or link to dataset source.

## Results
Achieved improved accuracy and reliability compared to single-model approaches.
